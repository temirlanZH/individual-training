Practice Makes Perfect And Individual training!

# Individual Training
Individual training or one-on-one training is typically the process of using a mentor or coach to teach a specific skill or behavior to an individual, to coach them, or to work on development on a one-on-one basis.

# Pros of Individual Training
Individuals can easily receive personalized attention, curricula, and coaching to ensure that they have everything to do their best
The individual’s specific barriers and obstacles can be approached and tackled by the coach or mentor
Curricula can be tailored to meet the individual’s current knowledge, learning speed, and adaptability

# Cons of Individual Training
Can be time-consuming and expensive
Individual training does not facilitate the same group/social retention of skills
Individuals who learn alone may not work as well in teams as individuals who learn in teams
